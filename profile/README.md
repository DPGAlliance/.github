## Overview

Welcome to the Digital Public Goods Alliance Github. We are an not-for-profit, multi-stakeholder alliance that stewards the [definition of 'digital public goods']https://www.un.org/techenvoy/content/digital-public-goods. Digital public goods (DPGs) are open-source products that advance the [sustainable development goals]https://sdgs.un.org/#goal_section. DPGs are open software, data, AI solutions as well as standards and content collections. Other than being open-source and platform independant, DPGs have to adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm by design and meet the [DPG standard]https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard. 

If you are curious to know about [how the alliance functions]https://digitalpublicgoods.net/what-we-do/, visit our [website]https://digitalpublicgoods.net/.

## How do we function as an open project/organisation? 
Various [partner]https://digitalpublicgoods.net/governance/ organisations of the DPG Alliance have seconded technical and managerial resources to the DPG Secretariate. The secretariate works closely with the community (YOU!) and experts (YOU!) to maintain openness of the DPG standard, reviews applications submitted by DPG nominees, and advocates for the [DPG registry]https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/, a database of digital solutions that are designated DPGs. We have [designed APIs]https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-api that can feed our database to other marketplaces, platforms, catalogues and registries e.g. [The Digital Impact Alliance Catalogue for DPGs]https://solutions.dial.community/.

## Get involved!
### 1. Contribute to the DPG Standard
The DPG standard is a baseline criteria for what a DPG must fulfill. There are 9 indicators of the standard which ensure the core design of the digital solution is open, and does not have vendor lock-in. It takes into account privacy and does no harm. It also lays down guidelines for how the documentation should be so that the DPG is replicable.

If you have any suggestions, please visit the [DPG Standard repo]https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/ and [contribute]https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/issues.

### 2. Nominate a Digital Public Good
If there is a product that is open source AND good for the society? It probably qualifies to be a DPG and should reside in the [DPG registry]https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/. You can nominate a digital solution that you know or have built yourself to be designated a digital public good. 

**Not sure if the digital solution will qualify as DPG?** We have an [eligibility tool]https://digitalpublicgoods.net/eligibility/ that can help you find out in a matter of minutes. You can also [submit an application]https://submission.digitalpublicgoods.net/ to be a DPG. If you need to find out more about the application process, go to our [submission guide]https://digitalpublicgoods.net/submission-guide/. 

All the applications recieved by the DPGA secretariate are processed on [publicgood candidates public repo]https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-candidates and applicants can track progress of the applications on [GitHub]https://github.com/orgs/DPGAlliance/projects/1. 

### 3. Validate a DPG application 
We want to open up the review process for the community to participate in. To that end, we have built a [validation tool]https://validate.digitalpublicgoods.net/ that crowdsources the vetting process. The tool was made by volunteers are we are seeking further help on development of this tool. If you are interested in contributing, [please holler]https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-validate/issues our team.
