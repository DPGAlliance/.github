Welcome to the Digital Public Goods Alliance's GitHub! We are a not-for-profit, UN-endorsed, multi-stakeholder initiative that accelerates the attainment of the sustainable development goals by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in [digital public goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods). Digital public goods are **open-source software**, **open data**, **open AI systems**, and **open content collections** that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm, and are of high relevance for the attainment of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Various [partner](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/governance/) organisations of the DPGA have seconded technical and managerial resources to the [DPGA Secretariat](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods-alliance-secretariat/). The secretariat works closely with the community (YOU!) and experts (YOU!) to maintain the openness of the DPG Standard, review DPG applications, and advocate for the [DPG Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry), a database of digital public goods. We also offer a [public API](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-api) that can feed our database to other marketplaces, platforms, catalogues, and registries. If you are curious to know more about how the DPGA functions, you should visit our [website](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/what-we-do).

## Get Involved!

| **Contribute to the DPG Standard** | **Nominate a Digital Public Good** |
| - | - |
| The [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard) is a set of specifications and guidelines designed to maximise consensus about whether a digital solution conforms to the definition of a digital public good. This standard, with nine (9) indicators is designed to complement other relevant principles and is applicable to DPGs in all sectors across the SDGs. If you have any suggestions, please visit the [DPG Standard repository](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard) and [contribute](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/issues). | If your product is open source AND good for society, you should consider applying! You can learn more about DPGs [here](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods), review the [eligibility requirements](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/submission-guide), or explore the registry of [existing DPGs](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry). You should also check out the [DPG Wiki](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/dpg-resources/wiki) for the application support documentation. |
