## Overview

Welcome to the Digital Public Goods Alliance Github. We are a not-for-profit, multi-stakeholder alliance that stewards the [definition of 'digital public goods'](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods/). Digital public goods (DPGs) are open-source products that advance the [sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/#goal_section). DPGs are open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content. Other than being open-source and platform independant, DPGs must adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm by design and meet the [DPG Standard](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard). 

If you are curious to know about [how the DPGA functions](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/what-we-do/), visit our [website](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/).

## How do we function as an open project/organisation? 
Various [partner](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/governance/) organisations of the DPGA have seconded technical and managerial resources to the DPG Secretariat. The secretariat works closely with the community (YOU!) and experts (YOU!) to maintain openness of the DPG Standard, reviews applications submitted by DPG nominees, and advocates for the [DPG Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/), a database of digital solutions that are designated DPGs. We offer a [public API](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-api) that can feed our database to other marketplaces, platforms, catalogues and registries e.g. [The Digital Impact Alliance Catalogue for DPGs](https://solutions.dial.community/).

## Get involved!
### 1. Contribute to the DPG Standard
The DPG Standard is a baseline criteria for what a DPG must fulfill. The standard has 9 indicators, which ensure the core design of the digital solution meets the criteria to become a DPG. It takes into account open licensing, privacy, relevance to the SDGs, and that the digital solution does no harm. It also lays down guidelines for documentation so that the DPG is replicable.

If you have any suggestions, please visit the [DPG Standard repo](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/) and [contribute](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/issues).

### 2. Nominate a Digital Public Good
Is there a product that is open source AND good for society? It probably qualifies to be a DPG and should reside in the [DPG Registry]([https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/signup). You can nominate a digital solution that you know or have built yourself to be designated as a digital public good. 

**Not sure if the digital solution will qualify as DPG?** We have an [eligibility tool](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/eligibility/) that can help you gauge how ready you are to be a DPG. It only takes a few minutes. You can also [submit an application](https://submission.digitalpublicgoods.net/) to be a DPG. To find out more about the application process, go to our [submission guide](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/submission-guide/). 

All the applications received by the DPGA Secretariat are processed on [publicgood candidates public repo](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-candidates), and applicants can track progress of their application on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/DPGAlliance/projects/1). 

### 3. Validate a DPG application 
We want to open up the review process for the community to participate. To that end, we have built a [validation tool](https://validate.digitalpublicgoods.net/) that crowdsources the review process. The tool was developed by volunteers and we are seeking further help on development of this tool. If you are interested in contributing, [please contact](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-validate/issues) our team.
